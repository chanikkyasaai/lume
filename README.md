## 🚀 **What is Lume?**

**Lume** is an innovative platform that transforms traditional AI interactions by creating **dynamic multi-persona AI councils**. Instead of chatting with a single AI, users can summon specialized AI experts who collaborate, debate, and provide comprehensive insights through voice and text interactions.

I'm currently working on this project to implement the **best product-ready application** with cutting-edge AI integration and user experience design.
